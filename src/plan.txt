BUGFIXING:
- sliding on ice should turn around (slope) + stopping on ice never restarts if make wall passable 
    need to check every frame for what am currently collided with, if only one obj then take the attribute of it

Game:
- Kill all runners within a centain amount of time and before they can collect all the checkpoints by controlling if certain walls are opaque or transparent

Ideas:
- after a set of levels, stim cave cooldown
- no stim mode setting: set all music to loop "rahhh anti-stim"
- stim cave, random button jumpscares
