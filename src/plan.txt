BUGFIXING:
- sliding on ice should turn around (slope) + stopping on ice never restarts if make wall passable
- level songs restarting on redo, cuz the ui_layer gets popped and pushed, make sure two levels with the same 'type' keep the same song playing in a row

Game:
- Kill all runners within a centain amount of time and before they can collect all the checkpoints by controlling if certain walls are opaque or transparent

Ideas:
- Faster levels are good
- text whenever a song plays to show songname and creator/s
- music fading in/out on death and pause menu and whenever a new songtype comes up

- after a set of levels, stim cave cooldown
- no stim mode setting: set all music to loop "rahhh anti-stim"
- stim cave, random button jumpscares





-- level 5 note: make the checkpoint for each 'key' at the bottom of the keyhole
