Theme: Space Whales
Special Object: PCB (Printed Circuit Board)

2D grid-based puzzle game about 'connecting' PCBs.

A Whale is X units long, and has sides with various traits:
- Solder: allows a connection to be connected
- Sealant: permanently closes a connection
- Connection: connects to the whale, locks the whale shape & to the PCB, whale can only move 'forward' until release
There can be multiple whales, player can only control one at a time, 'connect' to another whale to swap control

PCBs are connected squares with connections on the sides:
- Can be moved (pushed/pulled by whale/other PCBs)
- all sides with connections must either be: 
    - sealed
    - connected to other PCBs
    - connected to the whales

'Puzzle' completion is when all sides are accounted for and all PCBs are connected.
