- next_turn(), game phases
    - game.bord:trigger_buildings()
    - game.board:trigger_Event(game.game_state.event)
- buy new shop slots
- events (earth split)
- gold/bonuses

- 'no adjacent buildings' report all adjacent found
- refactor the rules to fit the game design

QoL:
- While holding a building, highlight all valid placement areas and how much bonus would be
- Star background, or anything really, should be moving to avoid boredom
