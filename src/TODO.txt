TODO:
- Figure out roles and what ppl want and what they wanna end up with
- Fix Textbox

Ideas:
- Shadow height:
Challenges: Balatro cheats it and has only two 'layers' that objects can be at, high/low. Where 'high' cards draw their shadow ontop of the 'low' layer. A more general case of infinite layers would be way too complicated to implement in 2d and would be better off with a 3d engine. (Raycasting edges to find where shadows go, but transparent sprites make that even harder, etc)

- Move the 'stim cave' to the background behind a modal, instead of its own separate page
