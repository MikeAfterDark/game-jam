### Theme: Loop

## Idea:

Train Looper: 
<= Build =>
- Points appear one at a time at some random location
- Points have a 'message box' with what connections they need and where
Connections:
1. Direct, from point A -> B, no intermediary
2. Indirect, can be A -> D -> C -> B 
- Sections of road can be build from any location and will be directional, 
  can be connected to another road in same direction or cross if across or wrong direction
- Sections can be deleted
- Once all Points are satisfied, 'play' round starts on 'Continue' button press

<= Play => 
- Trains will start moving for X amount of time, must complete a 'loop' of some points
- Any intersections will be managable to allow one path or another, a blocked path stops a train if its slow, crashes if fast
- If crash or ran out of time, prompt to re-path or try again
- Once all the trains are done after X time, start Build phase with current tracks
